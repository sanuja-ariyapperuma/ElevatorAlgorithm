# Elevator Algorithm with C# and .NET 8

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the elevator algorithm. The elevator algorithm is a simple algorithm that is used to schedule the movement of an elevator. The algorithm is used to determine the direction in which the elevator should move and which floor it should stop at next.

This is build using with Periority Queues and hoping to implement with the help of threads and UI.
